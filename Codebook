Data source:
  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Data files:

features.txt: List of all features.
activity_labels.txt: Links the class labels with their activity name.
X_train.txt: Training set.
y_train.txt: Training labels.
X_test.txt: Test set.
y_test.txt: Test labels.
subject_train.txt/subject_test.txt: Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

To achieve the following:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Analysis:
1. Read the data using the read.table
2. Add new column name "subject" to subject_test & subject_train
3. Add new column name "ActivityId" to y_test & y_train.
4. Add 2nd column name of the features.txt as a column name for the X_train & X_test 
5. Combine the columns for subject_train, X_train,y_train using "cbind"
6. Combine the columns for subject_test, X_test,y_test using "cbind"
7. Combine test & train data using "rbind"
8. Use grepl to find the column names that have mean or std in their name
9. Create a data set with the column names subject, ActivityId and other variables having mean or std in the name
10. Label the ActivityId by using the desciptions from the activity_labels.
11. Rename few columns appropriately.
12. load library reshape2 to use melt and dcast to create a tidy data file.
